======
Tuskar
======

Tuskar gives administrators the ability to control how and where
OpenStack services are deployed across the datacenter. Using Tuskar,
administrators divide hardware into "resource classes" that allow
predictable elastic scaling as cloud demands grow. This resource
orchestration allows Tuskar users to ensure SLAs, improve performance,
and maximize utilization across the datacenter.

Tuskar services are available via a RESTful API and management console
through which administrators are able to classify their hardware and
define their datacenters. In addition, Tuskar components provide
administrators with performance monitoring, health statistics, and
usage metrics, aiding in capacity planning and hardware procurement
decisions.
